###What is the PashLang project?
Pashlang is a combination of projects like an IDE, Compiler and Runtimes revolving around 1 interpreted language called PASM (Pash Assembly), which is the core language of this project.

###What is PASM?
Put simply, PASM is a lightning fast, extendable and configurable interpreted programming language.
The language design is similar to regular Assembly in the sense that every line is short and to the point, meaning every line does one small action at a time.

###Why not use another language like JavaScript or LUA?
#####You're in full control.
- The PASM engine allows you to change how much memory (RAM) it's allowed to use.
- All though a Standard library is provided called ```stdlib```, by default there is no library referenced to the engine, meaning the PASM code is suitable for low, medium and high trust environments.
- Libraries are easy to create, all you have to do is create a normal C# class, reference it and start writing methods!

###Does PashLang have an IDE?
Sure does!
